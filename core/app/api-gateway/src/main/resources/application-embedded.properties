# Configure h2 database connection.
# Application services use r2dbc reactive client, to connect to the database.
# Liquibase uses the jdbc client to connect to the database and we need to
# keep the in-memory DB alive until the JVM exit, this way the application can connect to the same
# database created by Liquibase execution.
