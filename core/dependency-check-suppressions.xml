	   FP: CVE-2022-2403 is a server-side vulnerability in the OpenShift Container Platform,
	   not a client-side flaw in the Fabric8 client or openshift-model JARs.
	   The vulnerability is a misconfiguration on the cluster itself.
	   The scanner has incorrectly attributed a platform CVE to a client library.
	   The only fix is to upgrade the OCP cluster.
