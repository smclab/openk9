	   FP: CVE-2022-2403 is a server-side vulnerability in the OpenShift Container Platform,
	   not a client-side flaw in the Fabric8 client or openshift-model JARs.
	   The vulnerability is a misconfiguration on the cluster itself.
	   The scanner has incorrectly attributed a platform CVE to a client library.
	   The only fix is to upgrade the OCP cluster.

	   Downgrading severity from Medium to Low. This finding applies to the Pekko Management port.
	   Mitigating Control: The port is only exposed internally
	   within our Kubernetes cluster network and is not accessible from the public internet.
	   The attack vector requires a prior breach of another service within the network.
	   The fix will be scheduled as a low-priority technical debt item.
